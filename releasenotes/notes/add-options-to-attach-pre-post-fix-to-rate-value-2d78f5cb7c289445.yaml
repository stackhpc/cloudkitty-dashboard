    Adds optional Horizon settings variable OPENSTACK_CLOUDKITTY_RATE_PREFIX
    and OPENSTACK_CLOUDKITTY_RATE_POSTFIX. These allow users to attach
    pre/postfix to their rate vaules shown at the dashboard such as currency.
    These values can be set in ``.py`` settings snippets under
    ``openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.d`` directory. Follow
    https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/settings.html
    for more details.
